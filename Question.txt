McDonald's is a global fast-food chain known for its diverse menu offerings. As a data analyst, your task is to analyze the nutritional content of the menu items available at McDonald's outlets. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the calorie count and nutrition facts of various menu items.

Objectives:
Extract meaningful information from the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the nutritional distribution and trends.
Create visualizations to present the calorie count and nutrition facts of different menu items.
Identify healthy and less healthy menu options based on nutritional content.
Timeline:
The project is expected to be completed within two weeks.

Deliverables:
A report (PDF) containing:
Description of data analysis approach and methodology.
Exploratory data analysis findings and insights.
Visualizations depicting nutritional information.
Source code used for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
Tasks/Activities List:
Data Collection: Download the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset from this link.
Data Preprocessing:
Load and inspect the dataset.
Handle missing values and data cleaning if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution of calorie counts across menu items.
Explore the nutritional content (e.g., fat, protein, carbohydrates) of different items.
Identify trends and patterns in the dataset.
Data Visualization:
Create bar charts, histograms, and box plots to visualize calorie distribution and nutritional content.
Compare nutritional characteristics of different food categories (e.g., burgers, salads, desserts).
Nutrition-Based Insights:
Identify menu items with the highest and lowest calorie counts.
Determine the average nutritional content of popular menu categories.
Documentation and Reporting:
Summarize the findings and insights from the analysis.
Explain how the nutritional analysis could benefit McDonald's customers and the organization.
Success Metrics:
The project should provide a comprehensive overview of the nutritional content of McDonald's menu items.
Visualizations should effectively convey calorie counts and nutritional information.
Insights should highlight healthy and less healthy food options.
Bonus Points:
Create a Jupyter Notebook or Python script detailing each step of the analysis.
Package your code and findings in a GitHub repository with a clear README.
Provide recommendations on how McDonald's could improve the nutritional profile of their menu.
